Short description of the dataset
This dataset is hourly meteorological data for LGA, JFK and EWR for the month of January 2013, which includes 358 rows representing hourly measurements and 15 variables.
The variables are:
origin, year, month, day, hour, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib, time_hour.

```{r}
mean(early_january_weather %>% pull(temp))
```
We have the mean temperature is 39.58212 F.
```{r}
